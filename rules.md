- *All members will be expected to contribute to tasks assigned to them or reach out for help.*

### 3) Conflict Resolution
- *Discuss with team leads first through a meeting, and if necessary we can escalate the issue to a TA or professor if the problem is not resolved in a timely manner.*

### 4) Expectation of Faculty and GTA's
- *If a team member fails to live up to this agreement, the situation may be reported to the staff, but the team will still be responsible for submitting a completed assignment. Staff will be available to meet with teams to resolve issues.*
